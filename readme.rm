# Text Highlights from Summary Tables

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to use the ChatGPT API to generate concise textual highlights from summary tables, focusing on changes in sales data across different stores. It automatically processes tables containing sales data and outputs significant changes, helping users quickly grasp key insights from the data.

## Example:

Given a table like the next:

| Store | Previous Week | Current Week | Weekly Variation | Weekly Variation % |
|-------|---------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Total | 6,665,548.38  | 6,342,993.81 | -322,555.0       | -4.84%             |
| 4     | 2,209,835.43  | 2,133,026.07 | -76,809.0        | -3.48%             |
| 2     | 1,998,321.04  | 1,900,745.13 | -97,576.0        | -4.88%             |
| 1     | 1,670,785.97  | 1,573,072.81 | -97,713.0        | -5.85%             |
| 3     | 443,557.65    | 410,804.39   | -32,753.0        | -7.38%             |
| 5     | 343,048.29    | 325,345.41   | -17,703.0        | -5.16%             |

The script is able to get highlights like: "Total sales decreased by $322,555.0 (4.84%). The decrease was driven mainly by a reduction of $97,713.0 (5.85%) in store 1."
